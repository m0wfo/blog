## tl;dr

I&#8217;m a software guy, and I look for hard [CS] problems to add value. I&#8217;ve spent the last decade solving these problems for a bunch of companies ranging from the biggest (by revenue) to the minuscule and everything in between; check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismowforth/" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a> if you&#8217;re curious.

I&#8217;m mostly based in Dublin, Ireland. I like cycling (Road and MTB), restoring old cars and doing road trips with newer cars when I get the time.

### Getting in touch

The best way to get in touch is either via email, _chris [at] mowforth.com_ or through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrismowforth/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>. I hang around <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/468112/chris-mowforth" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> a bit and am [increasingly rarely] on IRC as #m0wfo. Being a reclusive soul I tend to avoid social media.

I like to work on some open-source bits & pieces; you can find most of them on my  <a href="https://github.com/m0wfo" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>. Irrespective of code quality, these are probably the things I&#8217;ve worked on which have had the greatest cumulative impact:

  * <a href="https://github.com/m0wfo/cups" target="_blank">cups</a>&#8211; Common UNIX Printing System bindings for Ruby
  * <a href="https://github.com/sprintstack/sprintstack" target="_blank">SprintStack</a>&#8211; JVM-based compatibility layer for node.js, using Rhino and Akka
  * <a href="https://github.com/m0wfo/foxbat" target="_blank">Foxbat</a>&#8211; JRuby compatibility layer for EventMachine using Netty and JDK7 concurrency primitives

### Content & affiliations

This blog is an outlet for me to elaborate about projects I&#8217;m working on, talks I&#8217;m giving and sometimes just a scratchpad for me to remember stuff I&#8217;ll otherwise forget. I make no claim that any of it is correct, although I would claim that much of it is irreverent. I always endeavour to leave comments open in case there are any glaring errors or if something causes offence.
