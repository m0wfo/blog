## In a nutshell

I&#8217;m a software guy by training, although I don't really maintain this blog right now- to the extent that I do, it's more just a space for me to remember various technical trivia I found interesting or useful.

## Getting in touch

The best way to get in touch is via email, _chris [at] mowforth.com_.

### Technical bits & pieces

#### Code, talks, e.t.c

I like to work on some open-source bits & pieces; you can find most of them on my <a href="https://github.com/m0wfo" target="_blank">GitHub account</a>. Irrespective ofÂ code quality, these are probably the things I&#8217;ve worked on which have had the greatest cumulative impact:

  * <a href="https://github.com/m0wfo/cups" target="_blank">cups</a>&#8211; Common UNIX Printing System bindings for Ruby
  * <a href="https://github.com/sprintstack/sprintstack" target="_blank">SprintStack</a>&#8211; JVM-based compatibility layer for node.js, using Rhino and Akka
  * <a href="https://github.com/m0wfo/foxbat" target="_blank">Foxbat</a>&#8211; JRuby compatibility layer for EventMachine using Netty and JDK7 concurrency primitives

I try to upload anything beyond a 5-minute lightening talk [here](https://speakerdeck.com/m0wfo).
