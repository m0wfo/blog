Mainly for my benefit but if anybody else is interested:

  * [Architectural support for lock-free data structures (Herlihy & Boss)](http://www.cs.brown.edu/~mph/HerlihyM93/herlihy93transactional.pdf)
  * [An efficient STM using commit-time Invalidation](http://eces.colorado.edu/~gottschl/pubs/cgo10_inval.pdf)
  * [Dynamic performance tuning of word-based STM](http://wwwse.inf.tu-dresden.de/papers/preprint-felber2008tinystm.pdf)

I&#8217;ll add more once I get through this lot.
