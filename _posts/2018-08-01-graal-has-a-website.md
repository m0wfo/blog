It&#8217;s been quite an intense couple of days so far at the <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/projects/mlvm/jvmlangsummit/" target="_blank">JVMLS</a>; I&#8217;m going to do a proper write-up of what I learned, but in the meantime, I have to give a big shout out to Christian Wimmer from Oracle Labs for pointing me to Graal&#8217;s shiny new website <a href="http://www.graalvm.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. It was explained to me by other Oracle emplyees who shall remain nameless how hard it is to make stuff like this happen, but better late than never<img src="https://chris.mowforth.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 

More pertinently for me and other lang implementors is the subsection on Truffle <a href="http://www.graalvm.org/docs/graalvm-as-a-platform/implement-language/" target="_blank">here</a>.
