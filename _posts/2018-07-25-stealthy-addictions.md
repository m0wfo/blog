<p class="p1">
  I try to keep these blog posts pertinent to engineering, so here&#8217;s a curve-ball that hopefully still relates to tech in some capacity&#8230;
</p>

<p class="p1">
  A few disparate observations I’ve been replaying in my mind converged today and while at first sight they simply pissed me off or depressed me, I started asking myself why they were happening; the common answer for all of these things is addiction:
</p>

<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1">
    I’m in a toilet cubicle at work and hear a guy playing some dumb Facebook game in the adjacent cubicle while he&#8217;s supposedly answering a call of nature
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    I was stuck in a traffic jam with the roof down [much better rear visibility JFTR] a few weeks ago- three cars in a row behind me were openly using their phones (texting or otherwise staring at smart-phones for long periods of time)
  </li>
  <li class="li1">
    I have a lot of friends in London and have become increasingly cognizant of the phenomenon of moped-based cellphone theft- it seems the most vulnerable place where this happens is on a zebra crossing where the victim is more often than not either listening to music or engrossed in something on the device
  </li>
</ul>

Like many addictions, it&#8217;s easy to draw an imaginary demarcation line between the idiots who fall prey to such stupid behaviour and &#8216;me&#8217;, who would never possibly get caught up in anything so dumb.

Except that for the most part we&#8217;re dealing with the whole of society here, not just a portion with intrinsically addictive personalities or IQs of less than, I dunno, 90. I&#8217;ve seen plenty of amusing and ugly manifestations of addiction at various startups I&#8217;ve worked at, many amongst Ivy-leaguers and almost all of which are NSFW. And stock brokers and golden-circle lawyers play Zynga games on the shitter and get their phones robbed at junctions too.

An actual behavioural addiction- e.g. needing to communicate with somebody who isn&#8217;t in the same physical room (or world!) as you still somewhat stands out. I&#8217;m not a clinical psychologist but I can look at all of these examples and say, &#8220;that&#8217;s fucked up&#8221;.

What people who work in tech, or indeed anybody who stares at a screen all day needs to be aware of is the omnipresence of much more subtle, insidious but equally unrewarding & addictive uses of our time: ridding your Outlook calendar of every single conflict, sinking hours on a code review where the proposer has no intention of listening to you anyway, fixing _everything _that is wrong with your deeply fucked up team (was the last one perfect anyway?). Wait until the end of a working day and try and articulate what you did in sequence from start to finish. It&#8217;s surprisingly hard, but you&#8217;ll probably come up with some much better examples of recurring wasteful behaviour too.

It&#8217;s not my place to exhaustively catalogue addictive sources here because they are never-ending and growing in number, probably exponentially by virtue of the internet. But if you can occasionally stand outside yourself and say, &#8220;hey, that&#8217;s a not so smart- I could cut that out with no productive loss&#8221; about something you&#8217;re doing, you&#8217;ll probably be a slightly happier, if not more productive person.
