> There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.

Oscar Wilde was originally credited with that quip, but most SEO experts would agreee. IÂ had saved this title for a post on something constructive (a mid 10&#8217;s take on [Norvig](http://norvig.com/)&#8216;s mini lisp interpreter, using something cool like ANTLR 4 as a parser generator and then exploring the virtues of the Graal compiler for IR execution) but unfortunately more mundane events have recently usurped the title.

Since I&#8217;m engaged with 2 law firms (one of which is Golden Circle) in 2 separate jurisdictions [yeah, I comfortably have enough cash and connections for those retainers and billable hours without burning any stock options] I won&#8217;t elaborate on the details; suffice to say, muzzling bloggers is an intellectual cop-out; this isn&#8217;t the end of the story. In the meantime, thank you kindly for all the traffic!
