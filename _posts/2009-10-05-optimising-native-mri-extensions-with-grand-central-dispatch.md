I upgraded to Snow Leopard the other day and have been looking forward to being able to tinker with the nascent [GCD framework](http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/Reference/reference.html).

After three hours I [got something working](http://gist.github.com/202591), but underperforming. To be continued&#8230;

On another note, it&#8217;s a bit disappointing to see I can&#8217;t embed gists directly into Tumblr any more. C&#8217;est la vie I guess.
